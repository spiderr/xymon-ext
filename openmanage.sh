# openmanage.sh: Use Dell OpenManage to monitor hardware
#
# version 0.55
#
# Dell OpenManage XYMON script to monitor various pieces of hardware using the
# cli (omreport)
#
# Written by: Brian Smith-Sweeney
# Last Updated: December 6th, 2002
#
# This is my first attempt at a BigBrother script.  I've only tested this 
# script thus far on a RedHat 7.3 box with the ServerAdministrator-1.0-0,
# dellomsa-drivers-4.70-3613, and dellomsa-4.70-3613 rpms from Dell (although
# the version of ServerAdministrator is actually 1.2.3, not as the RPM implies
# 1.0)  I have tested chassis intrusion, power supply failure, and fan failure in 
# "real" situations", and the other options by passing it faked data.
#
# If you find the script useful or have questions/suggestions/flames 
# please drop me a line at bsweeney@physics.ucsb.edu.   Please note, as of yet
# this script has not been tested extensively; if you have good luck with it
# let me know.  I'll (hopefully) be updating this script fairly frequently 
# over the next few months, so check back on deadcat.net for updates.

#
# USAGE
# Standard XYMON external test.  Put this file in $XYMONHOME/ext on the Dell server
# running OpenManage and add a line to the $XYMONHOME/etc/bb-bbexttab like 
# the following:
#
#  : : openmanage.sh;60
#
# where the number after the semicolon represents how frequently (in seconds)
# you'd like the openmanage script to run.
#
#
# KNOWN BUGS:
# None, but there is a minor gotcha.  The output from some of the level-3
# omreport commands are somewhat extensive, and XYMON has a limit on how large
# a message you can send, so if multiple components have errors you may
# get a DATA TRUNCATED line in your XYMON openmanage status page.
#
#
# TODO:
# * Fix the above truncation problem by further parsing the output of the
#   level-3 commands to list only the sensors reporting problems
# * Add more support for the level-2 command "omreport system" and subsequent
#   level-3 commands
# * Add support for ignoring some components
# * Find the "unknown" bugs 
# * Maybe rewrite in perl when I get to parsing the logs
# * Add omdiag command?
# * Possibly divide up report pages
#
#
# HISTORY
# 0.1 - First version
# * Just parses the basics from omreport chassis
# 0.2 
# * Added "Command level 3" stuff for omreport chassis when level-2 command
#   reports issues
# 0.3 
# * Commented existing code
# 0.4
# * Fixed multi-word level-2 command output
# * Added an echo line to the fallback case alerting user in XYMONOUT file 
#   that we don't support that particular component yet.
# 0.5 - First version made public
# * General cleanup
# * Made it user-friendly to users who aren't me ;-) 
# * Added more notes
# 0.51
# * Added quick usage line
# 0.52
# * Fixed a nasty bug where Non-critical errors made reports green, even with
#   other critical errors present
# 0.53
# * Added Non-critical erros, made omreport chassis report parsing more robust
# 0.54
# * Fixed HTML tag in warning to include quotes
# 0.55
# * Added support for the Hardware Log chassis component via "omreport system esmlog"
